**GTFOBins** is a curated collection of Unix binaries that can be exploited to bypass local security restrictions, escalate privileges, or execute arbitrary commands on a system. The name stands for “**Get The F*** Out Binaries**,” referencing its purpose—to help users “get out” of restricted shells or limited environments. Each entry documents how a particular binary can be abused when available to a user with limited privileges, such as running commands, spawning shells, reading or writing files, and escalating privileges to root. The project is open source and maintained on GitHub, serving as an essential reference for security professionals, penetration testers, and system administrators.

GTFOBins can be used by red teamers or ethical hackers during **post-exploitation** phases to identify legitimate binaries already installed on a compromised system that can be used to **escalate privileges or bypass restrictions** without dropping external tools. For example, binaries like `vim`, `less`, or `tar` can be leveraged to execute shell commands if not properly restricted. Blue teams and administrators also use GTFOBins as a **defensive resource**—to audit systems for vulnerable configurations, apply least privilege principles, and remove unnecessary binaries from restricted environments. Using GTFOBins enhances both offensive and defensive security postures by bridging knowledge of what’s possible within legitimate system tools.
