### JSON Files

A ***JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)*** file is a plain-text, human-readable format for representing structured data using a small set of building blocks objects (curly-braced key/value pairs), arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null and is saved with a `.json` extension and served with the MIME type `application/json`. Because it’s language-independent and easy for both humans and machines to read and write, JSON is widely used for exchanging data between web services (APIs), storing configuration and settings, serializing objects for logs or persistence, and passing structured messages between programs or microservices. JSON is stricter than JavaScript literal syntax (for example, keys and strings must use double quotes), parsed by libraries available in virtually every programming language, and is ideal when you need a compact, readable way to represent nested data — but it’s not a database itself, so for large or frequently-queried datasets you’ll typically pair JSON with a proper storage system.
